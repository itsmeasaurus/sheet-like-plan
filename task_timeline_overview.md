# Task Timeline Project Overview

## Project Description
This is a React-based task timeline application that allows users to visualize tasks over time in a spreadsheet-like interface, similar to Google Sheets. The UI displays tasks with their status and shows marked cells to indicate when tasks are scheduled or in progress across multiple months.

## Components Structure
1. **TaskTimeline** - Main component that manages the task data and renders the timeline
2. **TimelineHeader** - Displays months and days in a spreadsheet-like header
3. **TaskRow** - Renders a single task with its status and timeline cells with blue marking for active days
4. **AddTaskForm** - Form for adding new tasks to the timeline

## Current Implementation
- The UI closely resembles a Google Sheet with a grid-based layout
- Tasks are displayed in rows with their names and statuses
- Each task has a status (color-coded): In progress (orange), Not started (gray), Completed (green)
- The timeline shows the first half of 2025 (January through August)
- Days are marked with blue cells to indicate when tasks are scheduled
- Task name and status columns are sticky (fixed) while scrolling horizontally
- Users can add new tasks through a form at the bottom

## Task Visualization
- AWS Learning: Continuous work from January through February
- NodeJS Review & Testing: Scheduled in blocks of 5 days across February and March
- Typescript: Scheduled in pairs of days across February and March
- NextJS: Scheduled for early August
- ReactJS: Not started yet
- Improving English: Continuous work from January through February
- Learning Thai: Scheduled twice a month (approximately every 10 days)
- Learning German: Scheduled twice a month (on the 15th and 25th)

## Future Enhancements
- Connect to MongoDB for persistent data storage
- Add functionality to mark/unmark days on the timeline through clicking
- Implement task editing and deletion
- Add drag-and-drop functionality for timeline management
- Create month navigation to quickly jump to specific months
- Add task filtering and sorting options

## How to Run the Project
1. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/
   ```

## Technologies Used
- React 19.0.0
- TypeScript
- Vite 6.2.0
- CSS for styling (with potential for Tailwind CSS integration)

# Task Timeline Component Overview

## Original Question
The user requested improvements to the Task Timeline component, specifically to place the month name (January) and date numbers (1, 2, 3...) in the same header row, with task cells below them. Additionally, the user wanted to improve the styling of the task rows and cells, prevent line breaks in status text, and remove empty space near the scrollbar.

## Agreed-Upon Solutions
1. Place month names and date numbers in the same header row
2. Display month names above the first day of each month
3. Improve the styling of task rows and cells
4. Ensure consistent styling and spacing across all elements
5. Maintain the spreadsheet-like appearance with proper borders and alignment
6. Prevent line breaks in status text by increasing width and using nowrap
7. Remove empty space near scrollbars for a cleaner appearance

## Final Implemented Solution
The following changes were implemented to improve the Task Timeline component:

### CSS Improvements
1. **Header Alignment**:
   - Aligned "Skills To Learn", "Status", and date numbers in a single row
   - Added month names above the first day of each month
   - Set consistent height for all header elements with proper padding for month names

2. **Month and Day Display**:
   - Created a combined month-day header that shows day numbers in the header row
   - Used CSS ::before pseudo-element to display month names above the first day of each month
   - Applied appropriate styling to make the month names and day numbers clearly visible

3. **Task Row and Cell Styling**:
   - Increased the height of task rows to 40px for better readability
   - Improved the styling of task names and status cells with better typography and colors
   - Created consistent borders and alignment for all cells
   - Added subtle hover and selection effects for better user interaction

4. **Status Text Improvements**:
   - Increased the width of status cells to 120px to accommodate longer text
   - Added white-space: nowrap to prevent line breaks in status text
   - Maintained consistent alignment and styling for all status indicators

5. **Scrollbar and Space Optimization**:
   - Removed unnecessary padding at the bottom of the timeline grid
   - Added custom scrollbar styling for a more polished appearance
   - Ensured consistent scrollbar behavior across all scrollable elements
   - Eliminated empty space near scrollbars for a cleaner interface

### Component Updates
1. **TaskTimeline.tsx**:
   - Restructured the header to display day numbers directly in the header row
   - Added data attributes to identify the first day of each month
   - Enhanced the cell structure with inner content divs for better styling
   - Used React.Fragment to avoid unnecessary DOM elements

## Key Information for Future Reference
- The header row now contains "Skills To Learn", "Status", and day numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Month names (January, February, etc.) appear above the first day of each month
- Task rows have a consistent height of 40px for better readability
- Status text displays on a single line without breaking
- All cells have consistent borders and alignment
- No empty space appears near scrollbars for a cleaner interface
- The component maintains proper scrolling behavior with fixed headers
- Selection and hover effects provide clear visual feedback to users
- The "Set Stage" button is always visible but disabled when no cells are selected, providing better UI consistency

This implementation provides a cleaner, more professional appearance for the Task Timeline component with improved visual alignment and a more intuitive layout that resembles traditional spreadsheet applications.
